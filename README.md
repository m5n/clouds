# Clouds
Nice (but resource-intensive) cloud animation.

Code in the &lt;body&gt;, css/clouds.css and js/clouds.js (except where noted) is all mine. 
All other code from https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate and used under the MIT license.

For best results, view in the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.
